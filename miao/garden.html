        <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr
            title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support,
          and abandoned browsers.</p>
        <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightement has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk
          like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>,
          and the major browser creators.</p>
        <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see
          with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the
          web.</p>

        <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen
          Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in
          the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr
            title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the
          external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a
          hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating
          what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure.
          Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beautyof the web; we can always push it further.</p>

        <h3>Participation</h3>
        <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <abbr
            title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well
          enough that even <abbr title"Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them as starting points.

        </p>
        <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr
            title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked
          this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
        <p>Download the sample <a href="/examples/index"
            title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified.">HTML</a> and <a href="/examples/style.css"
            title="This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify.">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have
          completed your masterpiece (and please, don&#8327;t submit half-finished work) upload your <abbr
            title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>file to a web server under your control. <a
